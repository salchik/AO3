Github / Webstorm / Git Tutorial
1. Install Webstorm
Head over to https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ to apply for a student license of Webstorm. Apply under 'Official Document' and enter in any necessary information.

Once approved, Webstorm can now be downloaded and installed as a local program if you are logged into your Jetbrains account. 

2. Install Git
Installing git through homebrew on Mac is the easiest way. Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads, and click on macOS. From there, open your terminal by searching it through the spotlight search. 

Install homebrew with this command by copying and pasting (/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)

After Homebrew has been installed, enter this command ($ brew install git)
Once installed, open Preferences, then Git in Webstorm. Enter in the location of Git in 'Path to Git executable.' 

Webstorm, Github, and Git are now successfully installed!
